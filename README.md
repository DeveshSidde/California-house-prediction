Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains the Python script, handsonii (1).py, which performs an in-depth analysis of data by executing different techniques, including K-means clustering, regression, and classification models. The script provides comprehensive insights into the application of different machine learning algorithms on a data set to predict outcomes and group data into meaningful clusters.

## Features
- Scaling of Data: Features are scaled to meet the expectation of various algorithms that depend on the distance between the data points, for instance, K-means clustering.
- Elbow Method: A plot on the sum of squared distances (inertia) of every point to its assigned cluster center, in order to decide on the best number of clusters.
- K-means Clustering: Segment data into clusters based on underlying patterns.
- Regression Models: Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression are applied with the objective of predicting continuous target variables.
- Classification Models: Classifiers such as Decision Tree and Random Forest are implemented to predict categorical variables given the input features.
- Visualization: Data points and model metrics are plotted to give a better, visualized understanding of the distribution in each model.
 
## Explained Models
- K-means Clustering: This unsupervised learning algorithm separates the dataset into K distinctive, non-overlapping clusters to minimize variance within each cluster.
- Linear Regression: Supervised learning algorithm which models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
- Support Vector Regression (SVR): This is the version of Support Vector Machine for the regression problem on an output variable with a prediction of both linear and nonlinear regression.
Decision Tree Classifier: This model mirrors the concept of a decision tree to go from observations about an item towards conclusions about the item's target value. It is simple to understand and interpret and can handle both numerical and categorical data.
- Random Forest Classifier: Ensembles learning method, which works in ensembling at multiple trees in the training time and outputs the mode of classes based on individual trees.
